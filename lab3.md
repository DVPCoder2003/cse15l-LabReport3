# Lab Report 3

## Of the 3 commands, I had chose ***Less*** and I had found 4 other alternatives (With the help of ChatGPT)

### These are the 4 commands that I had found

- `more`
- `cat`
- `head`
- `tail`


## `More`
- For this command, I had used the website [https://www.lifewire.com/more-command-4041467](https://www.lifewire.com/more-command-4041467)
- Similar to `less`, it gives us a way to view txt files but with different features. If it is too large, it shows you a portion, and you are able to control
whenever it goes down for the rest of the text. You could use s or d and b to go up or down respectively 
### **Example 1**

* The command I used was `more stringsearch-data/technical/government/Media/Abuse_penalties.txt`
